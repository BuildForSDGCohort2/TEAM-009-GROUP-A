# TEAM-009-GROUP-A
Build For SDG Cohort 2 project for group Team-009-group-a
I would to once again welcome you to this wonderfull project.
As mentioned earlier, we need to create some pages and linked them together.
The pages are the following: The login, the carrier page, the discussion page and the tracking page.
The login: we will use the Facebook Login API and insert it in our React project.
The Carrier page: we create a profile type of view where a potential carrier can modify his/her details.
The discussion page we be created the place where a potential user can request for a carrier and discuss with him/her.
tracking page will bbe a dashboard where a user can see the movement of his/her goods.
If you have more suggestions I am all hear... However keep in mind that we only have this month to make it happen suggest carefully.
